sample - cap

	copy and paste api 
	-uses folders , sqlite and php pdo 
		to create a simple way of having easy access to a database or
		a transparent base structure for a more sophisticated db-connector via web.

	- so many folders with SQL - Command Words
	as I always preferred the server to be responsible for authentication (i even like the popup)
	at the same time i always disliked url_rewriting and manipulation (mod_rewrite).
	the url should be read as clear as possible, thats the reason having alot of folders
	with nothing in it but an index.php.
	And it is the main reason for this little project:
	having an unified request-handling of sql-queries

	- as is ; it is not designed for large scale data-sets 
	
	- background

		# global-player-sites offer huge data-amount >>>	personalized small snapshot

	 	# there is no guarantie that the g-p-s keep and/or offer! the data in future.
	 		(not even on paysites >>> go to Ford and tell them you want to buy an 1934 Oldtimer,
	 			well it might/will become possible ; as soon as all plans are digitized and and and...
	 			but thats another story...)
		# cloud is great,but from  personal point of view its better having a real world disc.
